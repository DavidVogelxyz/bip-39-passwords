# BIP-39 Password Generation

This is a simple script to generate passwords using the Bitcoin BIP-39 list of seed words.

The script will ask the user for the numbers of words to use, and the number of digits to add. Then, it will pick random words from the list, and append a random string of numbers, to create a random password.

The word list can be found at [this GitHub link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bips/refs/heads/master/bip-0039/english.txt).
